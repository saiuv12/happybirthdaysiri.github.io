    <h4>When You're Feeling Thankful</h4>
    <p>Dear Siri,</p>
    
    <p> Hola Birthday girl!! As you reflect on the many things in life that fill your heart with gratitude,
      know that I am incredibly thankful for you. 
      Your presence in my life brings warmth, joy, and a sense of purpose and always motivates me.</p>

    <p>It's not just about the big moments or grand gestures;
       it's the little things that often go unnoticedâ€”the way you brighten a room with your smile, 
       the kindness in your words, and the love you share without reservation.</p>

    <p>Our journey together has been filled with beautiful moments, and each one has left a mark on my heart.
       Your compassion and support have been my anchor in times of storm, and your laughter has been the melody that echoes in my happiest memories.</p>

    <p>As you take a moment to appreciate the blessings around you,
       remember that you, too, are a blessing to me. Your uniqueness, strength, and the love you radiate make my world a better place.</p>

    <p>Here's to celebrating the beauty of gratitude and the countless reasons we have to be thankful.
       May this letter serve as a reminder of the love and appreciation that surrounds you, today and always.</p>

    <p>thankfully yours,</p>
    <p>Uv</p>  </div>
