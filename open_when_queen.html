    <h4>When You're Feeling queen</h4>
    <p>Dear Sirii,</p>

    <p>Happy Birthday mi queen!! As you open this letter, I want you to know that you are the queen by nature tho, 
      and you deserve to feel as royal and cherished as you truly are.
       Whenever you're feeling like a queen, remember that you reign in the world around you.</p>

    <p>Take a moment to appreciate the incredible person you are. 
      You possess grace, strength, and beauty that radiate like a true queen. Here are a few reasons why you are and should feel like queen:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Your kindness and compassion inspire everyone around you.</li>
      <li>Your intelligence and wit are regal qualities that set you apart.</li>
      <li>Your courage in facing challenges makes you a true queen of resilience.</li>
      <li>The way you care for others, attention to little things, reflects the benevolence of a benevolent ruler.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Remember, Siri, Even in chess queen's the strongest piece yet it gets attacked the most (facing troubles), 
      you are deserving of all the joy, love, and success that life has to offer.
       Embrace your inner queen, hold your head high, and know that I am here to support and cherish you in every way.</p>

    <p>You are loved, you are valued my queen.</p>

    <p>Knightly Yours,</p>
