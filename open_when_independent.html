    <h4> When You're Feeling Independent</h4>
    <p>Yohooo sirii</p>
    <p>Happy birthday, you independent soul! you always spoke your mind and never shyed away from being true and independent. So it's not jus anything new. So jus be the way you are </p>
    <p>Wishing you a day as vibrant and wild as your spirit,
        where adventures crackle in the air and dreams take flight untethered. </p>
    <p>   May this year be yours to conquer, solo or by your chosen tribe, 
        leaving a trail of laughter and triumph in your wake. Here's to you, shining bright and soaring free! âœ¨</p>
    <p>Independently yours,</p>
    <p>uv</p>
