    <h4>When You're Feeling Stressed</h4>
    <p>Hey Siri</p>
    <p>happy Birthday!! So, currently the most available feeling with every individual is stress. but it varies in dosage tho...</p>
    <p>I know things can get tough sometimes. 
      That knot in your stomach, the racing thoughts,
       the endless to-do list that seems to mock you from the fridge door â€“ stress can truly steal the joy out of the day. 
       So, if you're feeling overwhelmed, just take a deep breath (or ten! this majorly applies to me too) and
       know that you're not alone.
    </p>

    <p>Now, how about we fight back against this stress monster
    </p>
    <p>Stressfully yours,</p>
    <p>Uv</p>
