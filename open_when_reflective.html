    <h4>When You're Feeling reflective</h4>
    <p>Dear siri,</p>

    <p>Happy Birthday! As you take this moment to reflect, 
      remember that self-discovery is a beautiful journey.
       It's okay to pause, contemplate, and explore the depths of your thoughts. Here are a few things to consider:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Gratitude:</strong> Reflect on the things you're grateful for. What moments or people have made a lasting impact on your life?</li>
      <li><strong>Self-Discovery:</strong> Embrace the journey of self-discovery. What have you learned about yourself recently?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Remember, every moment of reflection is an opportunity for growth. Take your time, cherish the lessons, and know that I'm here to support you every step of the way.</p>

    <p>mirrorly yours,</p>
    <p>Uv</p>  </div>
