    <h4>When You're Feeling Low</h4>
    <p>So siri,</p>
    <p> Happy Birthday! But This was diffcult to write tho. I think often times you face yours lows all alone. it's not that you don't trust others. I guess you just don't want to bother others</p>
    <p> Even i wasn't able to be a great support when you are feeling low and to support you. </p>
    <p> So, I hope this letter comes to your aid if you ever face your lows alone.</p>
    <p>
      
      like the saying goes, In those moments when everything feels a bit heavy,
       I want you to know that you're not alone. I'm here for you, and I believe in your strength and resilience.</p>
  
    
    <p>You are stronger than you think, and I'm confident that brighter days are ahead.
      I won't tell you to reach me out or anything. But i'll try to be in your lows more often</p>

    <p>your high and low,</p>
    <p>UV</p>
