    <p>So Siri</p>
    <p>this will not appear to you on your birthday. It appears to you when you I get settled. </p>
    <p>One of the biggeset regret i got in my life is not confessing about my love back in 2019. 
        One big reason was UPSC, I always felt i propose to you and you might get distracted coz of it. So, I always waited to cofess my love, when the right time arrived.
        
        The thing is I was always sure that i loved you and always wanted to be with you.
        it is not a love at first sight or anything. The love i had for you grew gradually as the years passed by. Back then although 
        i was working. i know in no way i can ask you out. I wanted to ask you out when i built evrything for you stay comfortable, where in it can lead to marriage and can convince both the families.
        So, I planned to get settled by 2022. and ask you out about love and hoping to make you agree to marriage. But things didn't work out as i planned them.

        Then maybe coz of being away from home  for so long, didn't get any job(literally had a virtual clock, when you told me your parents agreed to delay your marriage proposals, you can't even imagine how happy, i was), or just lack of courage, I never told you how I felt.


        Then i watched this movie called, i want to eat your pancreas. So, the guy knows the end date of the girl as she'll be suffering from a cancer. Although he likes her. He'll be hesitant to say and waits to tell her during her last days.
        That is due to lack of courage. But she meets with an accident and dies much before the expected date.

        Now, Imagine a scenario, where I miss out to tell you, how i really felt about you all these years. And you get married without knowing about it.

        That'll be my biggest regret that i'd have for rest of my life.

        So, below is a mail that i wanted to send to you in 2020 and just saved it as a draft.

        Dear my Siri/boo/dumpy/dumpling,
        
        We met in 4th year of our college for MM fest. My first impression wasn't that great tbh.üòÇüòÖ. So later as days passed by we kinda became friends.When u cried infront of dinesh i was way too upset and angry and i never told u i felt so bad for couple of days tho? I still regret not hitting that dinesh on that day.Also, I was so happy when u came to look into robowars when ur rampwalk event was happening.I never told u,but that lil thing made me way too happy.i mean true that you were always a confidence booster.But at the very end of our fest that our bonds became a bit stronger due all the stuff that's happening between us and management.The meets we used to have in old canteen to chit chat and stuff i do miss thar tho. Also thanks to you i haven't read the passages for infy written test.I was able to select the options without reading the passages tht saved me a lot of time.Then happened our grad day.I was soo happy to meet u after a couple of months.and also got my mangas tho üòÅüòÄ.
        
        Fast cut to june and July periods.when u came to hyd i was so glad and happy as i can meet u every day.I did meet u.We went to sanju movie too and covered a good amount of eatries in and around himayat nagar.After i moved to infosys ur constant texts were reason for my daily dosage of confidence and assurance.
        
        Well i used to call you with all my sweetest and close nicknames. Dumplings...dumpzz..dumpy.. And yea "boo" .
        
        When u suddenly told me to stop calling u with nicknames i got a set back kinda stuff. That is the moment i got to know myself that i was being possessive and insecure about u. Of i don't call u with any nicknames. I thought i will be losing out you.
        
        I never felt the insecurity and possessivness that i had you on anybody else. I knew soon u were gonna feel too much of it and might stop talking to me.
        
        I was so afraid of this reality.I wanted u a lot,not jus for being a friend but more than that i realised that i fell for u boo.
        
        In the process of being best pals to love. There seems to be a thin line.I know that u were aware of that line and constantly had to re draw that line time after time.
        
        But it was me who was jumping that line and made to feel a bit insecure or to say losing a friend completely.
        
        It was true that i wanted a wish from u on my day.I wanted you to ask me how was my day.What was i dng remember a year ago u wished nd gave me that vid surprise. I wanted to he wished by that siri. In end even though i had people around me i felt alone. There was this missing feeling in me on bday with out ur wishes.
        
        I know u had a exam on that day i expected a bit more caring from you.But in reality it was i who should've asked u abt ur exam in depth and should've asked u how u fared in exam and stuff. Well it is more kinda my male ego tho. I do regret not asking u abt ur results nd being tough and waiting for your reply. I used to always see our chat history hoping you would ping me again everything might go back to normal in between us.
        
        So after u blocked/removed my contact i woke up from this ego.I had to do diaaster management so texted u to say sorry and to speak with u in a normal manner.
        
        But after that fight we seemed that we ain't that close.I had to change myself . I other people scenario i was able to change but in your case it was so hard. 
        
        It's true i didn't know much about you deeply. I only knew the stuff that u told me.I still wanted to know u deeply understand u and be with you.
        
        I proposed manju once due to my immaturity and i still regret that decision strogly in my life. So i never wanted to repeat that mistake.
        
        What If u never had any feelings on me and you jus being my constant best pal. What if u had any other guy in life that u liked. What if i told ok when u asked me not to call u by ur nickname instead of putting up a fight. What if i agreed to ur view on dany being alive in GoT. What if me being a bit light skinned and less stubborn.There were so many unanswered what ifs in my end?
        That i had to assume on my own.In the best possible assumption, wish and hope i had this in my mind to have a six or seven digit figured salary to be considering u to ask for proposal of that sort so to give u assurance that I'm serious abt u and wnat you for this life.
        
        I knew u were way too high for me to reach.I got my hopes on miracles in my life. And yeah one of the main reasons i did love you is that u never belittled my dark color tho. You gave me the respect and love and care to me.
        
        Even today i don't know if we could be atleast friends again.
        
        But i hope there comes a day where i can find that courage and propose you. And will scream out loudly to u that "I LOVE YOU". 
        
        If all my imaginary hopes and wishes were never came true in reality i still wanted to be your best pal the very least. 
        
        Aslo even today I'm afraid to lose u completely. 
        
        This letter might be a bit naive and kinda feel like trash too. 
        I did hope to spend my life with u like chilling netflix weekends together, 
        cooking the food together and starting a family up with u.
        
        I fell in love for ur never ending care and ur inner personality and the way u speak tho rather than ur outer beauty. The same can't be said from my end as i ain't got any special qualities like u. 
        
        And i know this letter is kinda weired too. 
        
        But one day u could tell ur grand children that even u had a person that kinda admired and loved u in his own way.
        
        I may never get a chance to speak to u.If you a had read this letter. So I'm jus gonna save this up. Maybe one day If i build enough courage and maybe hoping for a day even u get closer to me. So i can send u this. 
        If it ever happens to fall in love with u in real i would consider myself as a over achiever for sure.
        
        P.S. I Love You.'''

        
        The letter above speaks about my thought in the  past and how much I miss you.

        There's still so much stuff that i wanted to tell you. But I don't want you to think of me as a stupid, silly or upset with me.
    </p>

    <p>So Siri, I love you a lot and want to marry you ahve a family with you. I know it is too late and need to work a lot to get this done. But trust me, if you look down on the stuff after 25-30 yeras, It'll be all worth it.

        But in case you never had any feeling towards me. Atleast just  be my friend tho....
    </p>
    <p>forever Lovingly,</p>
    <p>Uv</p>
